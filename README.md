# Programmer Competency Matrix

</div>

Read in other languages: [Русский](README.ru.md)

## Hi all. 
Today is March 13, 2023, and it just so happens that for more than 3 years I have been actively studying python 
programming as well as data science. The contract ends in half a year and I decided that it was time to change 
activities from a radio engineer to a machine learning specialist. But how to evaluate myself, how to show the 
future employer what I know, how I can develop??? Divide and rule (lat. divide et impera) - says the maxim of the 
Roman Senate, let's approach the answer to the question asked systematically. Let's separate all the components of 
my specialist knowledge and evaluate them using the competence matrix.

Of course, I didn’t reinvent the wheel and took a ready-made matrix (the most common version was proposed by Sijin 
Joseph [here](https://sijinjoseph.netlify.app/programmer-competency-matrix/)) and honestly answered these questions, 
the answer was diligently put into separate files.
